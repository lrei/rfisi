Prototype management system for a physiotherapy clinic that specializes in carrying out treatment in the home.

The system allows for patients and physiotherapists to register in the system and specify their locations (address). The clinic manager can search for physiotherapists by distance from the patient when matching them for a treatment.

The physiotherapist can upload files describing the status of the patient.
